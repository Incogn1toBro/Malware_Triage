# Malware Triage
Basic PowerShell script to assist in conducting malware triage on a Windows device

### Use
Prior to executing the `Malware_Triage.ps1` script, ensure you launch PowerShell PSE as Administrator and edit the $Before and $After dates (Format: YYYY/MM/DD).

By default the script filters the last 7 days of recently written files. This can be amended on the `AddDays(-7)` section of code.

```powershell
./Malware_Triage.ps1
```
